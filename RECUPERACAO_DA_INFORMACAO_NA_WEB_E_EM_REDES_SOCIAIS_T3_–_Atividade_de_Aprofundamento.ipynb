But what is the difference between them, and why is it so important? Mercedes push-rod front suspension detail Photo by:  An F1 car\\u2019s suspension has an upper and lower wishbone \\u2013 triangular-shaped carbon fibre bars that absorb the shock from the road \\u2013 which essentially connects the chassis to the wheels.\\u00a0 Between the wishbones, both at the front and rear, is a suspension rod \\u2013 either a push-rod or a pull-rod \\u2013 that connects the wheel to a horizontal torsion spring. The torsion spring stores and releases energy, while twisting when force is applied to it, and that helps to keep a car stable over bumpy surfaces. A push-rod mechanism sits high up on the chassis where a diagonal rod then connects it to a low point of the wheel. So, over bumps or kerbs the wheel pushes on the torsion spring and that causes the push-rod to go upwards and towards the chassis.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 That is the opposite to a pull-rod. A pull-rod mechanism sits low on the chassis where a diagonal rod then connects it to a higher point of the wheel. This means every time the car hits a bump or kerb, the wheel pulls on the torsion spring which causes the pull-rod to go up and outwards from the chassis.\\u00a0\\u00a0 Both configurations have many advantages and disadvantages. It simply depends on what a team wants, because the suspension must fit the aerodynamic concept of the whole car as it plays a role in directing airflow towards the sidepod and other areas. For example, a pull-rod has better weight distribution because everything is run closer to the ground as heavy components are mounted towards the bottom of the chassis. This is especially important on ground-effect cars because the lower centre of gravity helps to reduce drag, aid cornering ability and arguably provide a better aero performance.\\u00a0 Red Bull pull-rod front suspension detail Photo by:  On the other hand, a push-rod is more practical as its local aerodynamic footprint is more favourable, which means the immediate aero around the suspension is cleaner. Furthermore, having the suspension parts higher on the chassis means it is easier for mechanics to work on the car, because if the front suspension has a pull-rod layout it makes the area quite cramped and sometimes the floor needs to be removed for certain parts to be accessed.\\u00a0 Ferrari SF-24 detail Photo by: Uncredited The push-rod can provide better stability, while it is also cheaper. Although a push-rod may work better for one car, it might not for another and vice-versa with the pull-rod \\u2013 sometimes, though, it comes down to deciding on aerodynamic and performance gains against cost and practicality in the ground-effect era. F1 teams can also split the use of both configurations by fitting a pull-rod at the front and push-rod at the rear or vice-versa.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Ferrari SF-23 pull-rod rear suspension Photo by:  Red Bull and   have been the only teams to use a pull-rod configuration on its front suspension for the past two years of ground-effect cars.\\u00a0But\\u00a0  and   have become the next teams to use a pull-rod configuration at the front for the 2024 season. The Swiss outfit has made extensive changes after finishing next-to-bottom in the 2023 constructors\\u2019 championship, while Red Bull's sister squad has taken a development direction similar to the world champions. What will help Sauber's transition is technical director James Key, who joined the team from McLaren in September 2023 even though it had already decided on a pull-rod before then.\\u00a0\\u00a0 Sauber C44 has pull-rod front suspension Photo by: Sam Bloxham /  He believes the aero gains of a pull-rod configuration far outweigh the practicality problems it presents because \\u201cit is all about managing your front tyre wake\\u201d \\u2013 a turbulent air flow around the car.\\u00a0 Key also thinks that more teams will follow suit as \\u201cfundamentally, it's the right thing to do\\u201d and there is probably no better example of that than Red Bull. Using a front pull-rod configuration, Red Bull has won the past two championships with rounds to spare \\u2013 including winning 21 of 22 grands prix in 2023 \\u2013 and its suspension played a pivotal role in that.\\u00a0 A pull-rod suspension has helped Red Bull to have a sharp front end which is exactly to the liking of world champion  , and the stiffness that presents gives the team a big advantage in the ground-effect era due to its low centre of gravity.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 But Red Bull uses a push-rod configuration on its rear suspension which is in line with most of the grid because Key thinks the debate \\u201cat the rear isn't a talking point really. It is mechanically better to go push-rod for various packaging reasons\\u201d as it can help to narrow the gearbox and alter the floor shape, which opens up downforce-producing performance at the car\\u2019s rear.\\u00a0 Red Bull's RB20 has push-rod rear suspension Photo by:  In 2024 eight teams will be using a push-rod configuration at the rear as opposed to five from 2023, because   and its customer outfits \\u2013 except for   \\u2013 have made the switch.\\u00a0  will be using a pull-rod configuration at the rear in 2024 as technical director Enrico Cardile explained how its rear suspension \\u201cis a bit different\\u201d to the Scuderia\\u2019s rivals, particularly  , so it is not as well-suited to a push-rod structure. Williams, meanwhile, decided to not go in the same direction as Mercedes for various reasons one being that there is a cost cap benefit in sticking to last year\\u2019s parts.

He used an inboard suspension on the Lotus 21 that finished second in the 1961 F1 championship.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Nelson Piquet, Brabham BT49 Ford Photo by: Rainer W. Schlegelmilch /  Brabham\\u2019s Gordon Murray then introduced the pull-rod configuration on a BT49 in 1979 and it was a revolution. This is because the pull-rod was much more flexible than the archaic hydro-pneumatic suspension which was used at the time \\u2013 meaning a car\\u2019s centre of gravity was lowered causing an improvement in performance. Over the coming seasons, Nelson Piquet won the 1981 drivers\\u2019 championship for Brabham, while other teams also attached a pull-rod suspension. However, the pull-rod suspension became much less used in the 1990s when a minimum ride height rule was introduced, which meant teams needed a higher centre of gravity.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 It returned to F1 in 2009 under revised regulations where the diffuser was moved rearwards. So, with Red Bull\\u2019s use of low sidepods, Adrian Newey believed attaching a pull-rod would help lower the RB5\\u2019s centre of gravity allowing for cleaner airflow to the car\\u2019s rear \\u2013 and it worked. Despite only using a single diffuser compared to Brawn\\u2019s double diffuser, Red Bull came very close to beating the eventual world champions with the diffuser simply proving to be the difference maker. Red Bull RB6 rear suspension Photo by:  \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 So, a double diffuser was attached to the RB6 alongside a pull-rod suspension and 2010 started a run of four consecutive double world championships for Red Bull and  . Red Bull started a trend, as 2011 saw 10 of 12 teams use a pull-rod before Ferrari and Sauber joined the majority the following year.\\u00a0\\u00a0 Ferrari became the last team to use a pull-rod suspension for several years, as the configuration featured on its SF15-T in 2015 before push-rods dominated once again.\\u00a0\\u00a0 But the reintroduction of ground-effect cars in 2022 presented the opportunity for pull-rod suspension system to return because of what can be gained by running closer to the ground. \",\n          \" ended 2023 having consolidated his status as one of the top four or five Formula 1 drivers, but also admitting: \\u201cI can do better.\\u201d In the context of a season of almost unprecedented perfection from  , the same could be said of any of Norris\\u2019s immediate rivals.  ,  ,  ,   and\\u2028  \\u2013 to list them in championship-finishing order \\u2013 all made mistakes at one point or another last season. But, in the case of Norris, you could see his point. On the one hand, his season was highly impressive. From the introduction of  \\u2019s first major upgrade in Austria, Norris was the second-highest scoring driver of the season with 193 points, 34 more even than the second Red Bull driver  . Norris outscored Leclerc by 41 points despite his and  \\u2019s strong end to the season, and Hamilton by 61. But, at the same time, there was a strong sense of what might have been. \",\n          \"Leclerc set the pace at Bahrain International Circuit in the last of three days of testing, beating Russell and   of  . Once again, testing was disrupted by a broken drain cover running for a second day in a row during the morning session. Leclerc lapped in 1m30.322s on the C4 tyre, which won\\u2019t be in use during next weekend\\u2019s Bahrain Grand Prix weekend, to set the fastest time of the day. Russell also bolted on the C4s for his final run of the test and lapped 0.046s shy of Leclerc\\u2019s time. Zhou did likewise and got to within three tenths of a second of their pace. Leclerc\\u2019s fastest time was 0.433s faster than  \\u2019s world champion Max Verstappen, who topped the opening day of running, who set his best time of 1m30.755s for fourth on the C3 compound that will be the season-opening event\\u2019s soft tyre. Yuki Tsunoda was fifth in Red Bull\\u2019s junior team, RB, also running C4s, ahead of   (Williams), Oscar Piastri (McLaren) and Fernando Alonso ( ). Carlos Sainz\\u2019s 1m29.921s, set using the C4 tyre during yesterday\\u2019s running, remained the fastest time of the week. He was ninth quickest today, having only run in the morning. The final day of testing was halted after only 27 minutes when a drain cover came loose on the outside kerb approaching Turn 11 \\u2013 the same spot where another drain was dislodged and disrupted running on Thursday. It appeared Red Bull's Sergio Perez ran over the loose drain but avoided major car damage, and the session was stopped for 1h17m in total for repairs and checks across the rest of the track. Sainz set the pace with a time of 1m31.247s, 0.236s ahead of Perez with Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) a further half a second in arrears. McLaren was limited to just 20 laps with Lando Norris due to a suspected clutch problem, while Valtteri Bottas was restricted to 28 laps for Sauber as the team worked on the floor and rear end of the car.\\u00a0 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
